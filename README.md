# ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning â€“ Andrew Ng (Coursera)

Welcome to my repository for **Machine Learning**, based on the [legendary course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) offered through Coursera and Stanford University. This repo contains all notes, programming exercises, and solutions created while taking the course, as well as some extended Python versions for practice.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Course

Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning course is one of the most popular introductions to ML, covering both theory and practical implementation. The course uses Octave/MATLAB for exercises, but many learners also translate them into Python.
